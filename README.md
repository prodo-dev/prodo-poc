# Self-contained MVP

This code is to illustrate some of the core concepts discussed in this [post](insert Medium post url).

- User app code is in `src/index.tsx` and `src/components/App.tsx`
- Prodo library code is in `src/@prodo`

It is deployed [on CodeSanbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/prodo-dev/prodo-poc).

If you were looking instead for the _current_ implementation of the Prodo framework, please head over [there](https://github.com/prodo-dev/prodo) instead.
