# Self-contained MVP

This code is to illustrate some of the core concepts discussed in this [post](insert Medium post url).

- User app code is in `src/index.tsx` and `src/components/App.tsx`
- Prodo library code is in `src/@prodo`

It is deployed [on CodeSanbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/prodo-dev/prodo-poc).

[![Edit prodo-POC](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/prodo-dev/prodo-poc/tree/master/?fontsize=14&module=%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApp.tsx)

The above code is only a proof of concept and should not be used in production. If you were looking instead for a more production ready version of the Prodo framework, please head over [here](https://github.com/prodo-dev/prodo) instead. To participate to the conversation and help us shape the future of Prodo, please don't hesitate to join our [Slack channel](https://prodo-feedback-slackin.herokuapp.com).
